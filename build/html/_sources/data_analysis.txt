How to reach your data
----------------------

If you decide to copy/paste your data to your local computer, we recommend the use of
`FileZilla <https://sourceforge.net/projects/filezilla/>`_.

 - Install FileZilla
 - Create and configure a new bookmark

You can now browse to your data by following the structure  **/HFIR/CG1D/IPTS-XXXX**

You are connected to your data
------------------------------

After your experiment has begun, your data will be automatically transferred to **analysis.sns.gov** if you are using
the CCD or the sCMOS detectors. If you are planning on using the CCD, your local contact will transfer the data for you.

Here is an example of the structure of your IPTS folder
